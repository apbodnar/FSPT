# Fragment Shader Path Tracer

I made this to explore photo-realistic rendering in web browsers. 
 
Requirements:
* An up-to-date desktop browser that supports WebGL 2 AND ES6 module export + import
* A top-end discrete GPU (for now)

Features:
* UE4 microfacet BRDF
* Image based lighting
* Area lights with light sampling (currently incorrect)
* Bokeh depth of field with variable aperture size
* Varible focus depth and auto-focus
* Normal maps
* PBR material maps. Metallicness, roughness, emissivity.
* Post processing: exposure, saturation, denoising
* HDRi importance sampling
* "Camera shaders"

TODOs (Not Exhaustive):
* Switch to a low discrepancy generator
* Re-add refraction
* Refactor texture packing to be far, far less wasteful of memory (current worst case could use megabytes where bytes are needed)
* Fix area light sampling
* Parallelize BVH construction and texture packing with web workers
* Faster BVH construction and traversal.
* Tiled rendering
* Port to WebGPU compute shaders once widely available

## Demo

**WARNING**: Any one of these links could crash your drivers/system. Run at your own risk. I recommend trying the links in order. If your system remains responsive, maybe try the next one.  
I've tested with FF and Chrome on Windows and Linux with a GTX 1080 and GTX 980

**Light sampling is currently broken**

Try messing with the mouse, scrolling, and WASD + RF keys.  Be sure to adjust the exposure and saturation.

## Forking

Run an HTTP server of your choice from the root directory.

**Warning** For some reason using javascript modules (`type="module"`) breaks python's SimpleHttpServer.
I recommend using Node's `http-server`

Depending on the port used, open a url like: http://localhost:8000/?scene=bunny&res=800

`scene` is the base filename of the scene json file you wish to render.  
`res` is the height and width of the canvas in pixels and defaults to the window dimensions if unused. Valid paterns are `res=<width>x<height>`, and `res=<square dimensions>` for a square viewport, `res=<scalar>x` to scale the internal resolution by 1 / `<scalar>`.

A scene config file like `bunny.json` looks like:

```

  "environment": "environment/autumn_meadow_2k.RGBE.PNG",
  "environmentTheta": 1.66,
  "cameraPos": [-0.751,0.665,1.820],

    }
  ]
}
```
`environment` is the epath to the HDRi environment map  
`environmentTheta` is the angle by which the environment is rotated about the y-axis  
`samples` is number of samples per pixels  
`atlasRes` is the resolution of the texture array used for all textures and materials in the scene
